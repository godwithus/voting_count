This project is used to calculate the results of election in a country (Nigeria), the task was to get the records from the pooling units result and then merge them together to get the results to a local government (LGA)  then the results of each local government are merged together to get political party that has the highest record in each state

=====================================================

This project help me to think outside of the box because I was given a database file to work on and just to make me stretch out my comfort zones the database was not well structured

For that reason I have learnt that when a task become more technical than I think I need to give it a short rest to avoid getting burn out 

Another thing I learnt is that each task leads me to learn a new thing in some other way also it make me  understand that I need to always pay attention to details
